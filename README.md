## Information Architecture

### Ontology:

#### General Idea

This site is all about students and how they plan to use their majors 
for their careers. The idea is that this page is a sort of profile 
on a set of students to give insight on who they are, what they're  
studying, their path to realizing what they wanted to do, and how 
they are going to use their studies to accomplish this.

While each of these students' majors, hopes, and future 
plans are laid out they are divided by their field of work. The two 
similar students are Famous, and Aliye, who both work with digital 
media and technology. The "Odd One Out" is Kaleb, who is a 
Political Science major and is looking at political science 
and research.

The students' lives, studies, reasons for interests or realization
of their interests, and future plans relating to the overall theme
are all shown. Along with each group of information there is a photo
or icon. Each has a profile picture of them. The other pictures are
random photos that give some sort of representation of the content near it.

#### Information Presented

In short the important things are:
- The overall idea of students using their education or jobs in
college for their future hopes
- Titles for each page that represent this and characterize
the information
- The students' names
- Information blocks about jobs, academics, life
- Picture of the student
- Other pictures representing the ideas
- Navigation between the two pages with a one
word simplified title referring to the page

### Choreography

The index/initial page is the Digital Communications page. The 
reason for this is because it demonstrates the themes a bit more 
than the politics page because it has 2 students and more content 
for each (due to layout and architecture thereof).They both have 
a similar header and navigation structure featuring a banner on 
the top of the page. After that, they diverge.

#### Header

Has the title of the page

#### Navigation

A Navigation bar with the following:
- Media: the index file
  - Is about the students using digital media
- Politics: The Odd Student file
  - Is about the student studying political science
  

#### Digital Communication Page (Aliye and Famous)

First is Aliye, then Famous. The reason for this is that
Famous's content has more about the discovery of the future 
plans. It made sense to put this second because it has more of 
a build up, so narratively having this at the end makes the most
sense.

##### Name of the student 
  
Their name is given, then a title referring to their content
and priming the reader for what they will read

##### Different Sections of Content

Each student has a series of sections of content containing
one or two subsections about the same thing.

- An about section: Lays out major and interests
- What led to them realizing what they wanted to do
- Putting this into practice with a job

#### Political Science Page

##### Main Picture

There is a large picture of Rochester city hall representing
both the hometown, politics, and local government aspects

##### Different Sections of Content

Each has a picture associated with it and a short blurb
of content.

The sections
- Personal life, and living in Rochester
- Political science majors and interests in the field
- Plans for future career

### Taxonomy

Again, each has the same banner (different title text) and
diverges from there.

#### Header

Within the header tag is the title with an h1 tag

#### Navigation

Nav element with a ul, and li with nested a tags

#### Images

Each image is represented with an img tag wrapped in a figure

The student names in the Digital communications page are h2 tags,
and the title of each paragraph is an h3 tag.

The title of each content section in the politics page is an h2.

#### Content Sections

Each content section of a picture and related titles and paragraphs
is represented by a section tag. They all have a common class "ContentBlock",
and individual ID's named after the student and the content inside

## Designer Notes
For this assignment, we decided to flip the requirements, meaning that the 
"Odd Student Out" accessory webpage will be presented in a Z pattern while
the two students found on the index page will be presented in an F pattern.

To the best of my abilities, I have employed the CRAP princples throughout 
the webpages that we were given. Contrast, for example, I had the figures alternate
positions on the index page to give readers more stimulation while reading through
each person's paragraph. On that same note, repetition comes into play when each part 
of the two students' stories I have kept the formatting the same via the grid layout.
On both webpages, alignment was key for me to accomplish, and I believe I have done that
through the grid layout, keeping everything squared off. Lastly, everything is in close 
proximity within each other. There is no excessive padding or margining between objects.
