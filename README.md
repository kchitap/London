# London
Lab 7 for Team London

## Ontology

The site is centered around 3 students. Each student has a major and a job (or two) presented.
For the two similar students the job is related to their major through the field it is in. For
the odd one out it is not related. Each student also has a random "fun fact", which is meant to
be sidebar (less important) content.

## Taxonomy

- <header> for the webpage title because the text inside
  acts as a heading for the whole website
- <section> for each distinct area of the page such as content 
  blocks because they are different sections of the page. I used
  sections for all of them because they represent sections of the
  F or Z layouts
- <h1> For the text of the header because it is the main
  heading for the website
- <nav> for the navigation between pages so that if the user
  does want to go back they can
  
### Index page

- <div> For the image in the center because it is different
  than the outer 4 sections and is not one of the Z layout 
  focal points
- <h2> Is used because it is the heading for the content
  in its section but is under the main site heading
- <p> is used because it is a paragraph of text under
  the h2 in its section
- <footer> Is the bottom of the page with information on
  the team and the original websites of the students
