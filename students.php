						<h4>Major</h4>
						<p>Hello Hello! My Name is the famous! I am computer science and digiatl media studies major.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="infoBlock">
						<h4>Jobs</h4>
						<p>I realized it was imperative for me to explore actual literature and historical artifacts, so I began researching the University of Rochester's Rare Books department. I came two laboratories that worked to craft three-dimensional representations busts, globals, and other sensitive items. Working with the Lazarus Lab and Digital Scholarship Lab brought me to a hybrid approach of Computer Science, Digital Media, and History that I never thought existed. In this approach, I use emerging technology to bring our past into the future and to breathe life and color into black ink on paper.</p>

					<h3>Famous' story</h3>
					<p>It happened one Spring ago as I sat studying in the dimly lit library stacks across from the Rare Books section at the University of Rochester in New York. I suddenly put it together: this was my approach to media and communication. Interactive history, digitization, a game. Presenting the wealth of past knowledge in ways future generations want to experience.</p>

						<h3>Kaleb</h3>

					</div>

					<div class="infoBlock">
						<h4>Major</h4>
						<p>I am a Political Science major, with a minor in CSC and a cluster in visual arts. My Political Science major has a focus on theoretical political science and the use of models in research.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="infoBlock">
						<h4>Jobs</h4>
						<p>The most noteworthy job I’ve had was as a canoe tripping guide for Camp Pathfinder, located in Algonquin Park Ontario. Camp Pathfinder acts as a host for kids from ages 7 to 15 looking to go on wilderness excursions. I spent the majority of my time out on canoe trips, however when needed I would act as a counselor. For my job as a guide, I was in charge of organizing, planning, and leading canoe trips for anywhere from two to fifteen days. A canoe trip consists of reaching different lakes each day by paddling and carrying the canoes.</p>
