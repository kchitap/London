			<h3>DIY Major</h3>
			<p> created my own major here at the U of R (a DIY major!), through the interdepartmental major track. I realized in my first year that none of the majors that were offered were exactly right for me, and started to look into the interdepartmental major option. Basically, you're petitioning the school that none of the majors would fulfil what you want to do.</p>

			<h3>Building the Major</h3>
			<p>My sophomore year, I began the process of designing my major, by having a lot of meetings with the Multidisciplinary Studies office, talking to many professors that I had taken classes with that I liked, and attempting to create a solid way of describing the major that I wanted to create.</p>

			<h3>Discovering a Path</h3>
			<p>This past summer was affirming that I’ve chosen the right path. I worked at a digital media and PR firm that works with classical musicians. I loved the experience, and worked on a lot of different projects for different artists. After graduation, I plan to pursue working on digital media for arts-based clients.</p>

			<h3>The Job</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>added content (mostly concert dates) to websites</li>
				<li>updated and checked up on Facebook pages</li>
				<li>worked with photo and video content</li>
				<li>updated PR logs</li>
				<li>helped to created digital media plans at the quarter</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Work in Film</h3>
			<p>Last fall, I studied abroad in London, and I had an internship at a firm that interviews film stars and filmmakers for promo for films, and edits them into YouTube videos. I had the chance to interview stars, directors, and producers for a film festival in junket setting (sitting down in a room with the movie poster behind you), as well as twice on the red carpet.</p>

			<h3>Photographs</h3>
			<p>I also love photography and the arts, and am a digital photographer, though I love working with film photography as well.</p>

			<h3>Class Inspiration</h3>
			<p> I took an Art History class about early photography, and we took frequent trips to the Eastman Museum as part of the course. I studied one of the nine remaining Daugerreotypes (the first form of permanent photography) of Fredrick Douglass, which was on loan at the Rare Books and Special Collections library at the time.</p>

			<h3>The Future</h3>
			<p> I hope at some point in my career, I’ll be able to combine my passion for photography and the arts and my work in Digital Media.</p>

		<h2>Famous: Coding and Culture</h2>

			<h3>Hopes and Plans</h3>
			<p>I could never state to know the entirety of my life's plan, however, since the onset of my involvement in undergraduate research, I can say with a degree of certainty that it would involve emerging media and historical preservation and education.</p>

			<h3>Working with U of R</h3>
			<p>I am computer science and digital media studies major. I work in two research labs. One in the ROC HCI lab in Wegmans under the guidance of Ehsan Hoque. I also work in the digial scholarschip lab in Rush Reeves library near the rare bare sections.</p>

			<h3>Making the Connection</h3>
			<p>It happened one Spring ago as I sat studying in the dimly lit library stacks across from the Rare Books section at the University of Rochester in New York. As I sat programming next to works such as Porch's "The French Secret Services," Howard's "The German Empire," and isles of history and knowledge I've never experienced, I suddenly put it together: this was my approach to media and communication. Interactive history, digitization, a game. Presenting the wealth of past knowledge in ways future generations want to experience.</p>

			<h3>From Here Forward</h3>
			<p>The future, however, will not be ordained solely by code and technology. I realized it was imperative for me to explore actual literature and historical artifacts, so I began researching the University of Rochester's Rare Books department.</p>

			<h3>Digitizing History</h3>
			<p>The Lazarus Lab, as well as the Digital Scholarship Lab in both in which I assist, have been looking into ways to bring rare artifacts out from behind velvet ropes and reinforced glass barriers. The project aims to digitize rare and fragile items to increase the range of audience they reach.</p>

			<h3>Modeling History</h3>
			<p>I came two laboratories that worked to craft three-dimensional representations busts, globals, and other sensitive items. Working with the Lazarus Lab and Digital Scholarship Lab brought me to a hybrid approach of Computer Science, Digital Media, and History that I never thought existed. In this approach, I use emerging technology to bring our past into the future and to breathe life and color into black ink on paper.</p>
